## Description

_This webpage was created for an independent project at Epicodus. It does not have a UI built, only javascript functions and prototypes. The scripts will take a users age and their life expectancy(life expectancy is input by the user). There is a prototype to figure out users age on Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars & Jupiter. There is also a life expectancy calculator for each planet, this calculates how many years up to the entered expectancy. If age is passed expectancy, output will be how many years passed the expectancy the users age is._
